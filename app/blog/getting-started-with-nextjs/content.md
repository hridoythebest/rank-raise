# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications with ease. In this blog post, we'll walk through the basics of setting up a Next.js project and creating your first page.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for faster load times.
- **File-Based Routing**: Automatically generates routes based on the file structure.
- **API Routes**: Easily create backend endpoints within your project.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will set up a new project with all the necessary dependencies.

## Creating Your First Page

Next.js uses the `pages` or `app` directory to define routes. For example, to create a homepage, you can add a file named `page.tsx` in the `app` directory:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App!</h1>;
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is a versatile framework that simplifies building modern web applications. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web app, Next.js has you covered. Happy coding!
